The twoSum file is a program that takes an array and a target number, and it finds two values in that array that add up to the target number. If there are no two possible values, then it will not output anything. This has a time complexity of O(n^2), so in order to reduce that, the hashTwoSum program uses a hash set. It takes the difference of each value of the array from the target sum, and it stores it in a hash set. It then displays the number and it's difference because those two will add up to the target sum. Because this only uses one for loop, as opposed to the nested for-loop in twoSum, it has a reduced time complexity of O(n).
